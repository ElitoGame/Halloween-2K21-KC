# Kineticraft Halloween 2021

This is the 1.16.5 datapack used on Kineticraft Server for the 2021 Halloween Event.
It has been developed by ElitoGame from September 2021 till October 2021.

## Features

- Scare Villagers for some Sweet Candy
- Trade Sweet Candy for new Masks to scare even more Villagers!
- Villagers recognize you, once you've scared them with that mask.
- There are 18 Masks, stored in binary per Villager.
- Eating Sweet Candy grants you awesome Buffs, active only in the Halloween Area, to make the grind worth it!
- 4 Types of Mobs, 3 varients of Zombies, 1 Boss spawning every half hour
- Mobs can drop Masks, or Sweet candy, but more likely Rotten Candy, which can be traded for even more Sweet Candy!
- 3 Dungeons, with varying difficulties! 
- Loot chests, refilling every 25 minutes with 3 rarities.
- Event explanation NPCs
- Progress messages once reaching a new level of scariness, that will grant you new Buffs from sweet candy!

## Availability
The Event was live for 4 days, but if you missed it, don't worry, the project is now open source and you can play around with it as much as you like! Once the v5 Map of Kineticraft is released, you will be able to play it in the right locations too!
